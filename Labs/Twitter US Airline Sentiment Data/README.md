# Lab Overview
In this lab, I have practiced to build an interactive data dashboard with [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) and [Python](https://www.python.org/). 

This lab showcases [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) for Data Manipulation and [Plotly Python](https://plotly.com/python/) to create interactive plots. Combining these two together, I was able to load, explore, visualize, and interact with the data and generate dashboard.

# Dataset
This dataset was obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/crowdflower/twitter-airline-sentiment). For this lab, I have only used the 'Tweets.csv' dataset. 

# Dependencies
